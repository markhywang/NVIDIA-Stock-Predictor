# NVIDIA (NVDA) Stock Forecasting using LSTM

Long short-term memory networks (LSTMs) are essentially a specialized type of recurrent neural network (RNN) used to learn sequential data and time series. LSTMs are more powerful in many tasks compared to vanilla RNNs as the usage of long-term memory cell states mitigates the risk of the vanishing and/or exploding gradient problem commonly encountered with vanilla RNNs.

In this project, an LSTM will be used to predict future Nvidia stocks. In fact, stock prediction is one of the most common examples where LSTMs prove to be extremely helpful.

Note that the actual stock market is naturally unpredictable and such models are not expected to work well due to the complexity of market dynamics, which involve not only historical prices but also macroeconomic factors, geopolitical events, and market sentiment. 

Nevertheless, LSTMs can provide useful insights and identify patterns in historical data, making them valuable tools for research and analysis in time-series forecasting.
